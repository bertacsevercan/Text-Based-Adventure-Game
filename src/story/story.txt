Once you reach the beginning of the Mount Qaf, you feel amazed by the majestic
mountain that you will conquer, at the end of this climb. You look at the snowy peaks while
thinking of how to start the journey. There is a hill before you.
+
As you go up the mountain, you see weird plants and flowers coming out of the mountains surface.
Suddenly, you hear a thunder like growl and feel the breeze of giant wings behind you.
You tilt your head up and see a dragon flying towards the top of the mountain.
You've heard stories that this, is no ordinary mountain and they seem to be true.
You've reached a higher level of the mountain and saw a door with a lock, hanging in the air, unattached.
You also saw a path up to the mountain however; there is a human-sized bird in front of it.
