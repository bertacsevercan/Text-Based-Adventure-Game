Once you reach the beginning of the Mount Qaf, you feel amazed by the majestic
mountain that you will conquer, at the end of this climb. You look at the snowy peaks while
thinking of how to start the journey. There is a hill before you.

As you go up the mountain, you see weird plants and flowers coming out of the mountains surface.
Suddenly, you hear a thunder like growl and feel the breeze of giant wings behind you.
You tilt your head up and see a dragon flying towards the top of the mountain.
You've heard stories that this, is no ordinary mountain and they seem to be true.
You've reached a higher level of the mountain and saw a door with a lock, hanging in the air, unattached.
You also saw a path up to the mountain however; there is a human-sized bird in front of it.

Once again, you have climbed up on the mountain.
The air started to feel heavier. A cold breeze crawled up on your neck as it was snowing.
You hugged your arms around your chest, wishing to pack a thicker jacket.
In the distance, you saw a cave and filled with hope to get in and get warm.
The cave's entrance small, however, the inside was vast, filled with icicles on the ceiling.
You sat down on a rock trying to get warm and all of a sudden you felt as if you weren't alone.
You stand still to listen to hear its breathing. Then you hear a big laugh echoing on the surface of the cave.
Darkness says "There come many travellers here to conquer this mountain, however very few can pass this point".
You were too scared to answer. The voice continued "Answer my riddle correctly and I'll let you pass, it's that simple!
As small as your thumb, I am light in the air,
you may hear me before you see me, but trust that I'm there.
What am I?".
